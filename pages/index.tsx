        has been thought with one intention: it aims to be one of the easiest tool to build web3 projects on top of the Ternoa Chain. Based on Polkadot.js API
        and Javascript, it offers application developers the ability to query substrate chains like the Ternoa chain. It provides a seamless experience and
        allows you to start building at a glance : an extra short init and just a few lines of code after, you will create your NFT.
        <br />
        The E2E test dApp is the easiest way to test our SDK. You can submit any transaction to the chain to manage your NFTs or familiarize yourself with our
        helpers with the code snippets.

        Ternoa ecosystem is based on 2 environments: Alphanet & Mainnet, where transactions are conducted in $CAPS token.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Alphanet stands for the gateway to explore and test the Ternoa chain. It uses test $CAPS tokens claimable on our faucet here:

            .
          </li>
          <li>Mainnet is the main chain where data is stored.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        By default the dApp is connected to the Alphanet chain. You can swith to Mainnet by clicking on the pill located on the top right corner.
