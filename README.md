## ternoa-js SDK

[Ternoa-js SDK](https://github.com/capsule-corp-ternoa/ternoa-js) has been thought with one intention: it aims to be one of the easiest tool to build web3 projects on top of the Ternoa Chain. Based on Polkadot.js API
and Javascript, it offers application developers the ability to query substrate chains like the Ternoa chain. It provides a seamless experience and
allows you to start building at a glance : an extra short init and just a few lines of code after, you will create your NFT.
